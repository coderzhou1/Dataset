# Dataset
Here is the dataset used in my paper titled "A Chinese Named Entity Recognition Method for Landslide Geological Disasters Based on Deep Learning." The dataset is divided into a training set and a validation set, named l.train.csv and l.dev.csv respectively.

The dataset is partitioned into training, validation with an 9:1 ratio, comprising 4185, 465 entities correspondingly (as outlined in Table).
